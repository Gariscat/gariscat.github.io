This is Xinyu Li's homepage!

I am doing my M.Sc. of Machine Learning at MBZUAI, the first academic institution exclusively for the AI research located at Abu Dhabi, UAE. Before that, I finished my B.Sc. of Science at New York University, double majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science. My reseach covers multiple disciplines, including AI for music, reinforcement learning for robotics and large language models, etc. Meanwhile, I am a songwriter and electronic music producer, having started playing the piano since primary school. I have also played as a drummer for our rock bands since middle school. Content including my CV, my research and publications, my blog posts and my music releases are all available on this site. They are posted to keep track of my progress, but at the same time it would be great if any of then help or inspire you in some way.
